## üå± Phase 1: Introduction to Data Analytics

My journey started with my passion for Mathematics, problem-solving and coding! 

Here is where I realized how my first steps at work where as a BI Analyst at the **Business Intelligence (BI)** department. I focused on:

- **Data Analysis & Reporting**: Using tools like **SQL Server**, **Excel**, and **Google Analytics** to provide actionable insights.
- **Communication with Stakeholders**:  Collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver data projects aligned with business goals.
- **Problem Solving**: Implementing solutions that reduced operational downtime by 20%.

This phase gave me the foundational knowledge to understand how data drives decision-making within organizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 2: Diving Deeper into Advanced Tools

As I moved forward, I expanded my technical skill set with tools like:

- **Python**: For scripting, automation, and data manipulation.
- **SQL**: Writing complex queries for database management.
- **Tableau & Power BI**: Creating interactive dashboards for stakeholders to visualize key metrics.

---

## üíª Phase 3: Automation and Process Optimization

To improve efficiency and help my team focus on strategic analysis, I began:

- **Automation**: Reducing manual work by automating data processes using Python scripting. One significant project included reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks by 40% with Python automation.
- **Data Dashboards**: Building real-time dashboards to monitor key metrics across various sectors such as Energy, Telecommunications, and Insurance.
